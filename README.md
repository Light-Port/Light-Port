The Filecoin Network and IPFS are innovative decentralized data storage solutions.

The Problem
However, they are not easy to use filecoin network due to technical difficulties experienced by users.
There are also some problems with the services that help to solve this 'accessibility problem'.
so, the accessibility problem is not completely solved.

The existing platforms that help people upload data to the Filecoin network have two problems that hinder accessibility.

1) Fixed payment currency - 
Users can only pay in dollars or stablecoins on existing platforms.
This means that many users with altcoins are forced to convert them to stablecoins through swap. 

2) Fixed payment method - 
On traditional platforms, users are forced to use a monthly subscription.
If users are unable to afford this monthly payment, they may give up using the Filecoin network.

We solved these "accessibility issues" to make the Filecoin Network accessible to more users.

Solution

1) Altcoin payments: 
Users can pay filecoin nodes with altcoin assets on various mainnets.
Users can use their own assets as payment currency.
When users pay their altcoins to pay for storage on filecoin nodes, 
No swaps are required and no assets need to be bridged.
The protocol takes care of everything the user needs to do to pay the Filecoin node.

2) Pay with a combination of coins: 
Users will also be able to pay with a combination of different altcoins.
For example, if you need to pay 10 FIL, and the FIL coin is $3 at the time, you will need to pay $30. 
If the user's coins are usdt klay matic, the user can decide how many dollars they want to pay in each coin for a total of $30.
This makes it more convenient for users to pay for uploading data to the Filecoin network.

3) Pay for each transaction: 
The platform allows users to pay each time they want to upload data to the Filecoin network.
Users can pay for each transaction, which makes uploading to the Filecoin network more affordable.

In this protocol, we have implemented both the upload to IPFS and upload to Filecoin network. 
Most importantly, we have implemented three additional features from a UX perspective to make it more convenient for more users to use the Filecoin Network.
These are the powerful features of our protocol.
